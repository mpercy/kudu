[[rn_1.9.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Flume 1.8+ requires Java 8 at runtime even though the Kudu Flume integration
  is Java 7 compatible. Flume 1.8 is the default dependency version as of
  Kudu 1.8.0.

* Hadoop 3.0+ requires Java 8 at runtime even though the Kudu Hadoop integration
  is Java 7 compatible. Hadoop 3.1 is the default dependency version as of
  Kudu 1.8.0.

[[rn_1.9.0_obsoletions]]
== Obsoletions


[[rn_1.9.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 has been deprecated since Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

[[rn_1.9.0_new_features]]
== New features
* Kudu now supports location awareness. When configured, Kudu will make a best
  effort to avoid placing a majority of replicas for a given tablet at the same
  location. The `kudu cluster rebalance` tool has been updated to act in
  accordance with the placement policy of a location-aware Kudu. The
  link:https://kudu.apache.org/releases/1.9.0/docs/administration.html#rack_awareness[administrative
  documentation] has been updated to detail the usage of this feature.

* Docker scripts have been introduced to build and run Kudu on various operating
  systems. See the `/docker` subdirectory of the source repository for more
  details. An link:https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/kudu[official repository] has
  been created for Apache Kudu Docker artifacts.

* Developers integrating with Kudu can now write Java tests that start a Kudu
  mini cluster without having to first locally build and install Kudu. This is
  made possible by the Kudu team providing platform-specific binaries available
  to Gradle or Maven for download and install at test time. More information on
  this feature can be found <<developing.adoc#,here>>. This binary test
  artifact is currently considered to be experimental.

[[rn_1.9.0_improvements]]
== Optimizations and improvements
* When creating a table, the master now enforces a restriction on the total
  number of replicas rather than the total number of partitions. If manually
  overriding `--max_create_tablets_per_ts`, the maximum size of a new table
  has effectively been cut by a factor of its replication factor. Note that
  partitions can still be added after table creation.

* The compaction policy has been updated to favor reducing the number of
  rowsets. This can lead to faster scans and lower bootup times, particularly
  in the face of a “trickling inserts” workload, where rows are inserted slowly
  in primary key order (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1400[KUDU-1400]).

* A tablet-level metric `average_diskrowset_height` has been added to indicate
  how much a replica needs to be compacted, as indicated by the average number
  of rowsets per unit of keyspace.

* Scans which read multiple columns of tables undergoing a heavy `UPDATE`
  workload are now more CPU efficient. In some cases, scan performance of such
  tables may be several times faster upon upgrading to this release.

* Kudu-Spark users can now provide the short “kudu” format alias to Spark. This
  enables using `.format(“kudu”)` in places where you would have needed to
  provide the fully qualified name like `.format(“org.apache.kudu.spark.kudu")`
  or imported `org.apache.kudu.spark.kudu._` and used the implicit `.kudu`
  functions. The
  link:https://kudu.apache.org/releases/1.9.0/docs/developing.html#_kudu_integration_with_spark[Spark
  integration documentation] has been updated to reflect this improvement.

* The `KuduSink` class has been added to the Spark integration as a
  `StreamSinkProvider`, allowing structured streaming writes into Kudu (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2640[KUDU-2640]).

* The amount of server-side logging has been greatly reduced for Kudu's
  consensus implementation and background processes. This logging was determined
  to be not useful and unnecessarily verbose.

* The web UI now more obviously depicts which columns are a part of the primary
  key (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2477[KUDU-2477]).

* The `kudu table describe` tool has been added to support describing table
  attributes, including schema, partitioning, replication factor, column
  encodings, compressions, and default values.

* The `kudu table scan` tool has been added to scan rows from a table,
  supporting comparison, in-list, and is-null predicates.

* The `kudu locate_row` tool has been added to allow users to determine what
  tablet a given primary key belongs to, and whether a row exists for that
  primary key.

* The `kudu diagnose dump_mem_trackers` tool is added to allow users to output
  the contents of the `/mem-trackers` web UI page in a CSV format.

[[rn_1.9.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues
* To avoid glitches and undefined behavior, the Kudu Python client now
  detects and reports on conflicting/incorrect initialization of the OpenSSL
  library.

* Fixed a crash caused by a race between altering tablet schemas and deleting
  tablet replicas (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1678[KUDU-1678]).

* Fixed an issue that would prevent the `kudu fs update_dirs` tool from
  removing directories in the presence of tablet tombstones (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2680[KUDU-2680]).

* The `--cmeta_force_fsync` flag may be used to fsync Kudu's consensus
  metadata more aggressively. Setting this to `true` may decrease Kudu's
  performance, but improve its durability in the face of power failures and
  forced shutdowns (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2195[KUDU-2195]).

* Fixed an issue that would cause an excessive amount of RPC traffic from Kudu
  masters if the tablet servers were configured with duplicated master addresses
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2684[KUDU-2684]).

* Fixed an issue that would cause the `kudu cluster rebalance` tool to run
  indefinitely in the case of tables with a replication factor of 2 (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2688[KUDU-2688]).

* Fixed an issue that could lead to a failure to bootstrap tablet replicas
  that were a part of workloads with many alter table operations
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2690[KUDU-2690]).

* Fixed an issue with the Java scanner's `keepAlive` that could lead to a
  permanent hang in the scanner (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2710[KUDU-2710]).

* Fixed an issue that would cause undefined behavior upon connecting to a
  secure cluster concurrently from multiple C++ clients (see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2706[KUDU-2706]).

[[rn_1.9.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.9.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.9 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.8 and Kudu 1.9 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.9 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.9 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.9 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.9 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.9.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.9.0


[[rn_1.9.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.9 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.8. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.8 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.9 client library and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.9 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.8.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.8 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.9 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.9 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.8
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.9 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.8. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.8 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.9 client
  and vice-versa.
